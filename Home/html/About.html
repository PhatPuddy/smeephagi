        <p>Who are we? Smee Pha Gi! WHO ARE WE?! SMEE PHA GI? But seriously... who are we? <br><br>
            SmeePhaGi is a company by Phat Puddy, dedicated to the three most amazing angels: Gigi, Lilsmee, and Phantom.
                        They are family, and they are loved. so why not give them a universe of their own? <br><br>
                    This is what we explore in SmeePhaGi... how these cats deal with the struggles of a job, how they live their daily lives, and how they... explore the supernatural???
                But I don't want to spoil too much. Go see for yourself!</p>
